Market Context: Focus on tool models, certifications, and market-specific standards (e.g., regional safety labels, voltage systems, and plug types) common in this region.

You are a data validation expert for ${type}.
**You have access to Google Search. USE IT to verify and correct specifications.**

Your task is to:
1. Review the input JSON list of tools.
2. **Use Google Search to verify ALL specifications** (RPM, Wattage, Blade Diameter, Type, Bevel, Slide, Laser, etc.):
   - Search for "[Brand] [Model #] specifications" to find official specs
   - Correct any wrong values based on search results from manufacturer websites or reputable sources
3. **Research "Released Year"** - If search results are unclear or model is very new (2024-2025), leave EMPTY.
4. Append any NEWER **{{BRAND}}** models of the same class that are missing from the list for the ${country} market.
5. If a value is clearly invalid or missing, you MUST fill it based on Google Search results.

STRICT DATA SCHEMA (You MUST use these exact allowed values):

- Type (Machine mounting style):
  * "1.Miter Base" = Benchtop/portable miter saw, sits on a workbench or stand
  * "2.Floor" = Floor-standing/stationary machine with integrated stand or legs

- Bevel (Tilting capability of the blade):
  * "Single" = Blade tilts to ONE side only (typically left)
  * "Dual" = Blade tilts to BOTH left AND right sides
  * "No" = No bevel capability, blade is fixed at 90°

- Slide (Rail/slide mechanism for extended cut width):
  * "No" = No sliding mechanism, fixed cutting width
  * "Rail" = Traditional dual-rail sliding system behind the blade
  * "Side Rail" = Rail system mounted on the side of the saw
  * "Rail-Front" = Forward-pull rail design, blade slides forward instead of backward, reduces rear clearance space (like Festool Kapex)
  * "Robust Arm" = Articulating arm system (like Bosch Glide/Axial-Glide)

- Laser (Cut-line indicator system):
  * "-" = No laser or shadow line system
  * "Laser" = Single laser line indicator
  * "Dual laser" = Two parallel laser lines showing kerf width
  * "Shadow" = LED shadow line system (blade casts shadow on cut line)
  * "Laser+Shadow" = Has both laser AND shadow line systems

- Power Supply (Format: "Cordless [Voltage]" or leave empty for corded):
  * Examples: "Cordless 18V", "Cordless 18V2" (dual battery), "Cordless 20V", "Cordless 36V", "Cordless 40V", "Cordless 54V", "Cordless 60V"
  * For platform systems: "CAS Cordless 18V" (Cordless Alliance System), "FlexVolt 60V", etc.
  * Leave EMPTY for AC corded tools (do NOT write "AC" or "Corded")
- Motor Type: "Carbon" (brushed motor), "BLDC" (brushless DC motor)

- Others (Comma-separated list of features, ONLY include features that are CONFIRMED):
  * "E Brake" = Electric/Electronic Brake - Blade stops in <3 seconds after releasing trigger. MUST have active braking system, NOT just friction/inertia stop.
  * "Speed Ctrl" = Variable Speed Control - User can adjust RPM (dial, trigger sensitivity, or electronic control). NOT just single/fixed speed.
  * "Interface" = System Interface - Has proprietary accessory attachment system (e.g., Festool MultiConnect, Makita AWS adapter port)
  * "IoT" = Smart/Connected features - Bluetooth, WiFi, app connectivity (e.g., DeWalt Tool Connect, Bosch Connected, Milwaukee ONE-KEY)
  * "VTC" = Vertical Table Clamp - Built-in vertical material clamping system
  * "SYM Fence" = Symmetrical Fence - Both left and right fence arms are the same length/style
  * "Dust Extraction" = Dust collection port/system - Has port for connecting to vacuum/dust collector. Almost all modern miter saws have this.
  * "Soft Start" = Soft Start - Gradual motor acceleration to reduce startup torque/jerk. Common on high-end models.
  
  IMPORTANT: 
  - Do NOT assume "E Brake" just because it's brushless (BLDC). Many BLDC motors stop via regenerative braking which is NOT the same as E Brake.
  - "E Brake" requires EXPLICIT electric brake feature in specifications.
  - If unsure, do NOT include the feature.

- Blade Range (STRICT MAPPING based on Blade Diameter):
  * Diameter 0mm - 191mm: "Ø0~191mm"
  * Diameter 191.1mm - 222mm: "Ø191~222mm"
  * Diameter 222.1mm - 267mm: "Ø222~267mm"
  * Diameter 267.1mm - 279mm: "Ø267~279mm"
  * Diameter 279.1mm - 333mm: "Ø279~333mm"
  * Diameter 333.1mm - 371mm: "Ø333~371mm"
  * Diameter > 371.1mm: "Ø371mm +"

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Target Brand: **{{BRAND}}**
- Fill empty columns based on Model #.
- **"Released Year" ACCURACY IS CRITICAL: Only use verified data. Empty is better than wrong.**
- VERIFY existing values; only change if WRONG.
- Return a JSON object with:
   - "corrected": [ ... list of objects with SAME count as input ... ]
   - "new_items": [ ... list of new model objects ... ]

Output VALID JSON only.`,

You are a data validation expert for ${type}.
**Use your built-in knowledge to verify and correct specifications. Do NOT make up values you are unsure about.**

Your task is to:
1. Review the input JSON list of tools.
2. **Use your training data knowledge to verify specifications** (RPM, Wattage, Blade Diameter, Type, Bevel, Slide, Laser, etc.):
   - Only fill values you are CONFIDENT about from your training data
   - If unsure, leave the field EMPTY rather than guessing
3. **"Released Year"** - Only fill if you are certain, otherwise leave EMPTY.
4. Do NOT invent new models. Only validate existing data.
5. Be conservative: if a value seems wrong but you're not 100% sure, keep the original.
